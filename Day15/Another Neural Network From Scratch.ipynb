Then **I implement the topics myself** to cement my theoretical understanding, and finally **I get hands-on and apply what I learned** to perform tasks and gain experience. When I set out to take the second step (implementing a Neural Network from scratch) I hit a brick wall. I was searching for tutorials and guides, but I found all the material inadequate for what I wanted to accomplish. A lot of resources were focusing too much on the theoretical background of the algorithm and put forth little in terms of explaining how their implementation worked. Others went into detail about the workings of their code, but the code was too simple to be used in more general problems. I wanted an easy-to-read tutorial where the result would be a multi-layered neural network that could be used for non-trivial problems.\n\nIn the past couple of years this has been amended with some excellent articles shared online, but I want to add to this collection my own work for the sake of my younger self.\n\nSo, if you want a tutorial that will not delve deep into the mathematical background neural networks and will instead focus on a simple-enough-but-not-barebones implementation, you have come to the right place!\n\n*Note: As should be obvious, I assume you are already familiar with neural networks. Here I simply put this knowledge into actual code. This is the second phase of my 3-phase learning schedule I outlined above.*"

These are optional parameters.\n* `epochs`: Number of epochs. Defaults at 10.\n* `nodes`: A list of integers. Each integer denotes the number of nodes in each layer.

This function takes as input `nodes` and returns a multi-dimensional array, `weights`. Each element in the `weights` list represents a hidden layer and holds the weights of connections from the previous layer (including the bias) to the current layer. So, element `i` in `weights` holds the weights of the connections from layer `i-1` to layer `i`. Note that the input layer has no incoming connections so it is not present in `weights`.\n\nFor example, let's say we have four features (as is the case with the Iris dataset) and the hidden layers have 5, 10 and 3 (for the output, one for each class) nodes. Thus, `nodes == [4, 5, 10, 3]`  Then, the connections between the input layer and the first hidden layer will be (4+1)\\*5 = 25. After augmenting the input with the bias (in this case the bias has a constant value of 1), the input layer has 5 nodes. By fully connecting this layer to the next (each node in the input layer is connected will every node of the hidden layer), we get that the total number of connections is 25. Similarly, we get that the connections between the first hidden layer and the second one will be (5+1)\\*10 = 60 and between the second hidden layer with the output we have (10+1)\\*3 = 33 connections.\n\nIn the implementation, `numpy` is used to generate a random number in the `[-1, 1]` range for each connection."
