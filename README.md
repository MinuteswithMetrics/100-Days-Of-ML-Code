# 100DaysOfMLCode  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who’s ready to take the 100 days of ML code challenge? That means coding machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days. Pledge with the <a href=https://twitter.com/William33712308/status/1015290320416894979">#100DaysOfMLCode</a> hashtag, I’ll give the first few winners a shoutout!</p>&mdash; Siraj Raval (@sirajraval) <a href="https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2018</a></blockquote>

The above tweet explains how this repo started. This will be the journal for 100DaysOfMLCode pledge. I will add the progress I make everyday and will publish the code at regular intervals once I make enough progress with some task/problem.
