# 100DaysOfMLCode  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who’s ready to take the 100 days of ML code challenge? That means coding machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days. Pledge with the <a href=https://twitter.com/William33712308/status/1015290320416894979">#100DaysOfMLCode</a> hashtag, I’ll give the first few winners a shoutout!</p>&mdash; Siraj Raval (@sirajraval) <a href="https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2018</a></blockquote>

The above tweet explains how this repo started. This will be the journal for 100DaysOfMLCode pledge. I will add the progress I make everyday and will publish the code at regular intervals once I make enough progress with some task/problem.

| [Day 3](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day5) | Linear Algebra |* Begin reading chapter 2</br> * Wrote a blog post titled [Linear Algebra! Ain’t Nobody Got The Time For That](https://medium.com/@dskswu/linear-algebra-aint-nobody-got-the-time-for-that-ee0c98cfdf25 "Linear Algebra! Ain’t Nobody Got The Time For That") </br> * Created notebook to save my notes</br>

| [Day 5](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day6) |Probability and Information Theory |* Wrote a blog post </br> * Completed Chapter 3: Probability and Information Theory |  
| [Day 6](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day7) | Numerical Computation |* Wrote a blog post:[WAYEMENT…. Calculus!](https://medium.com/@dskswu/wayement-calculus-e7577fabd58f "WAYEMENT…. Calculus!t") </br> * Completed Chapter 4: Numerical Computation|  
| [Day 7](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day7) | Machine Learning Basics |* Wrote a blog post:[Oh My Guudness….. Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@dskswu/oh-my-guudness-machine-learning-46fc4acf745d "Oh My Guudness….. Machine Learning") </br> * Completed Chapter 5: Machine Learning Basics|   
| [Day 8](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day7) | Machine Learning Basics |* Wrote a blog post:[Oh My Guudness….. Machine Learning II](https://medium.com/@dskswu/oh-my-guudness-machine-learning-ii-1068a7abc09b "Oh My Guudness….. Machine Learning II") </br> * Completed Chapter 5: Machine Learning Basics| 
| [Day 9](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day10) | Updating my notes on Deep Learning Part I |* Began prepping for a project to apply what I learned |  
| [Day 10](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day11) | Finally some gun detection |* Training is much faster on Colab</br> * While each training step took 20-30secs on local CPU, on Colab it was 2-3 seconds </br> * Initial loss with ssd model was close to 30 </br> * Using faster rcnn, initial loss was 3 |  
| [Day 11](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day12) | Train using Faster RCNN |* Collected more images from IMFDB</br> * Used 250 images for training</br> * Took 20mins for the loss to reduce to 0.4 |   
| [Day 12](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day13) | Set up Raspberry Pi |* Recently got a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</br> * Setting up Raspberry Pi was easy </br> * Installed Raspbian OS</br> * VNC-Viewer is a handy tool for desktop sharing |  
| [Day 13](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day14) | Object Detection on Raspberry Pi |* Steps followed for Ubuntu helped a bit</br> * Installed TensorFlow and skipped Protobuf </br> * Used generated protobuf files from Ubuntu</br> * Faced issues, Stack Overflow was helpful |  
| [Day 14](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day15) | Real Time Object Detection on Raspberry Pi |* Used OpenCV for connecting to the USB camera </br> * There was some delay in the inference </br> * Because number of frames per second was close to 0.8 </br> * Using Pi camera instead of a USB camera might improve fps rate  |  
| [Day 15](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day16) | TensorFlow Model Zoo |* TensorFlow Model Zoo is a repository of many pre-trained models </br> * ssd_mobilenet_v1_ppn_coco is based on Pooling Pyramid Network architecture</br> * PPN is a new variant of Single Shot Detector </br> * This pre-trained model is more than 3x times smaller in size when compared to ssd_mobilenet|  
| [Day 16](https://github.com/theimgclist/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Day17) | Read about Face Processing |* Shape of the face, Albedo and reflectance are three major components of face processing </br> * Albedo map captures variations in skin pigmentation</br> * In case of unconstrained environment, a lot of external factors are dynamic </br> * In constrained environment, there will be some agreed upon standards |
