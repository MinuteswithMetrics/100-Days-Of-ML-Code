But the title **\"Pneumonia Detection\"** for the competition is misleading because you actually have to do **\"Lung Opacities Detection\"**, and lung opacities are not the same as pneumonia. Lung opacities are vague, fuzzy clouds of white in the darkness of the lungs, which makes detecting them a real challenge.\n\nThis kernel is for people who want to understand what lung opacities are and how come there are \"No Lung Opacity / Not Normal\" images. In this kernel I will show images from different classes (Normal; No Lung Opacity / Not Normal; Lung Opacity) and write my interpretation of the **opacities** in the image. I will cover some basics of chest radiography and focus only on the lungs because \"Lung Opacities\" appear only in the lungs. Write your questions in the comments section and I'll answer them as best that I can.\n\nMy name is Guy Zahavi, I am a physician (anesthesiology resident) and graduate bioinformatics student. I am not affiliated with the competition hosts or Kaggle, I'm just excited about this competition :)\n\n*I took the code for this kernel from Peter Chang's awesome [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/peterchang77/exploratory-data-analysis).

If you compare the images of Sample Patient 1 and Sample Patient 2 you can see that the lower boundry of the lungs of patient 2 is obscured by **opacities**. In the image of Sample Patient 1 you can see the clear difference between the black lungs and the tissue below it, and in the image of Sample Patient 2 there is just this fuzziness. \n\n## What are opacities and what can we understand if we see them?\n*In reply to [Arya Mazaheri](https://www.kaggle.com/aryanet)*\n\nUsually the lungs are full of air. When someone has **pneumonia**, the air in the lungs is replaced by other material - fluids, bacteria, immune system cells, etc. That's why areas of opacities are areas that are grey but should be more black. When we see them we understand that the lung tissue in that area is probably not healthy. \n\n## Normal vs. Lung Opacity images\n"

If you see a round white small opacity in and around the lungs it's probably an ECG sticker.\n\n# Some considerations when building your model\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\n## Localization vs. Segmentation of Opacities\n*In reply to [Arya Mazaheri](https://www.kaggle.com/aryanet)*\n\nAs you can see, lung opacities are not homogenoues and they do not have a clear center or clear boundaries. I don't think you can properly segment opacities out of the entire picture because there are no clear boundries. However, if you can segment the lungs properly and filter out the rest of the image, you could create a clean image of the lungs for your neural network to process *(clean as in data cleaning, not clean of pneumonia or opacities)*. An implementation of [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) for such a segmentation can be seen at [Lesson 2: Lung X-Rays Semantic Segmentation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mdai/ml-lessons/blob/master/lesson2-lung-xrays-segmentation.ipynb) on Google Colab.\n\n## How accurate are the annotated boxes?\n*In reply to [Arya Mazaheri](https://www.kaggle.com/aryanet) and [Mikheil Azatov](https://www.kaggle.com/mazatov)*\n\nThere is a known variability between radiologists in the interpretation of chest radiographs. In a study by [Neuman et al. (2012)](https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/126918/reliability-cxr-pneumonia), there was only a moderate level of agreement between radiologists about the presence of **infiltrates**, which are opacities by definition.\nGoing through the images of this competition, I believe that the presence and position of the annotated boxes would vary between different radiologists."

Other non-pneumonia opacities may be present. Also, some of the not normal cases have subtle abnormalities which require a trained eye to discern. (Which, for now, keeps radiologists around.)\n\nIn the next section I'll try to put it all together and give a clear definition of the opacities annotated in this data set.\n\n\n# A Clear and Detailed Definition of Pneumonia Associated Lung Opacities\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)\n\nWhy does the chest radiograph change when a person has pneumonia? To answer this question we have to ask what is pneumonia first.\n\n![Pneumonia](https://jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/934929/m_jpg160003fa.png)\nCredit: Thompson AE. [Pneumonia. *JAMA.*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2488310) 2016;315(6):626. \n\nPneumonia is a lung infection that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Because of the infection and the body's immune response, the sacks in the lungs *(termed alveoli)* are filled with fluids instead of air. The reason that **pneumonia associated lung opacities** look diffuse on the chest radiograph is because the infection and fluid that accumulate spread within the normal tree of airways in the lung. There is no clear border where the infection stops. That is different from other diseases like tumors, which are totally different from the normal lung, and do not maintain the normal structure of the airways inside the lung.\n\n## Consolidation vs. Ground-Glass Opacity\n\nLet's compare two patients -"

The best solution is probably some combination of both of them.\n1. Try to predict the \"Target\" from the meta-data, like Ann Antonova's excellent kernel [Practical EDA on numerical data](https://www.kaggle.com/aantonova/practical-eda-on-numerical-data), or Giulia Savorgnan's informative [DATA LEAKAGE: ViewPosition (PA/AP) matters](https://www.kaggle.com/giuliasavorgnan/data-leakage-viewposition-pa-ap-matters).\n\n2. I would try to predict the \"Target\" from the image itself with a neural network, independently of the opacity boxes prediction. \n\n"

      "source": "Weiteng007 asked an interesting question - **Can a lung opacity occur if the lung is removed?**. The answer is **yes and no**. An opacity can occur where the lung was once, but it cannot be a **lung opacity**. This **white lung** phenomena in chest radiographs is termed \"hemithorax white-out\" or \"hemithorax opacity\". \n\nSeeing a \"white lung\" on a chest radiograph leads to the question - **if we see only an opacity where the lung is supposed to be, what happened to lung?**. These are some possible answers:\n- The lung was removed in a surgery called **pneumonectomy**.\n- The lung is filled with fluid from pneumonia and what we see is a **[pneumonia associated lung opacity](#A-Clear-and-Detailed-Definition-of-Pneumonia-Associated-Lung-Opacities)**. \n- The lung is there but it is surrounded by fluids inside the chest cavity (termed **[pleural effusion](#Pleural-effusion)**).\nIt's hard to tell just by the chest radiograph what is the cause of the \"white lung\". \n\nSince this competition is about penumonia, and these patients have a \"Target\" value of 1, the cause for their big opacity is most probably pneumonia. Meaning - they have a **pneumonia associated lung opacity** over their entire lung.\n\nYou can see more examples of \"white lungs\" in [this radiopedia artice](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hemithorax-white-out-differential).\n\n## Unclear Abnormality\n[Back to top](#Table-of-Contents)"
