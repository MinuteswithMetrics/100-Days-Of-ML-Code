**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .
  
**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : July 07 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress**   Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations
  
**Thoughts** : I completed EDA on Blood Donations data. 
**Project Description:**   [Predicting Blood Donations](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/)

## Day 2 : July 08 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress**   Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations
  
**Thoughts** : Implemented basic machine learning models to predict blood donations. Currently ranked 935/4530 on the leaderboard. 

**Project Description:**   [Predicting Blood Donations](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/)

**Next Steps:**  Explore using advance deep learning models and try to climb the leaderboard. .

## Day 3 : July 09 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress**   Read Deep Learning Chapter 2: Linear Algebra written by Ian Goodfellow
  
**Thoughts** : I will setup a notebook to make notes and record references. 

**Project Description:**   [Deep Learning](www.deeplearningbook.org/)
